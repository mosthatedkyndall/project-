<h3>Every four years the United States of America hold the presidential election. It is a long process until it is finally clear who will be the new president. In the US, Democrats and Republicans are the two big competing parties. As a first step, the Democrats and Republicans chose their candidates in the primaries, who then compete against each other during the election campaign. In this clip we give you a detailed explanation of every step in the presidential election.</h3>

<h3>Problems with America</h3>

<p>One major thing wrong with the world right now is all the crime.The unfair police system. The killings led to protest , protest led, to more killings, more killings led to more trails, and trials led more and more protest. Its a repeating cycle and the only way to stop it is for someone to make a change. I can be that change. All the protesting is just leading to more and more violence. The prostest arent helping us they are hurting us because more and more people are being hurt.The protest are just sepaerting us . Both sides say they are trying to make peace. But as you can see its not working how we thouht it would.I dontn think that people shoukd have to fear for their life or there loved ones. But if you elect me as president I will be your change. So elect me as President 2016. I  </p>
